            <p>The headache wouldn't go away. She's taken medicine but even that didn't help. The monstrous throbbing in her head
            continued. She had this happen to her only once before in her life and she realized that only one thing could be
            happening.</p>
            <p>There were a variety of ways to win the game. James had played it long enough to know most of them and he could see what
            his opponent was trying to do. There was a simple counterattack that James could use and the game should be his. He
            began deploying it with the confidence of a veteran player who had been in this situation a thousand times in the past.
            So, it was with great surprise when his opponent used a move he had never before seen or anticipated to easily defeat
            him in the game.</p>
            <p>Her hair was a tangled mess which she tried to make presentable by putting in a lump on the top of her head. It didn't
            really work although it was a valiant attempt. While most people simply noticed the tangled mess on top of her head,
            what most people failed to understand that within the tangles mess was an entirely new year. That was her secret. She
            kept worlds on top of her head.</p>
            <p>The fog was as thick as pea soup. This was a problem. Gary was driving but couldn't see a thing in front of him. He knew
            he should stop, but the road was narrow so if he did, it would be right in the center of the road. He was sure that
            another car would end up rear-ending him, so he continued forward despite the lack of visibility. This was an unwise
            move.</p>
            <p>Do you really listen when you are talking with someone? I have a friend who listens in an unforgiving way. She actually
            takes every word you say as being something important and when you have a friend that listens like that, words take on a
            whole new meaning.</p>
            <p>The robot clicked disapprovingly, gurgled briefly inside its cubical interior and extruded a pony glass of brownish
            liquid. "Sir, you will undoubtedly end up in a drunkard's grave, dead of hepatic cirrhosis," it informed me virtuously
            as it returned my ID card. I glared as I pushed the glass across the table.</p>
            <p>Sleeping in his car was never the plan but sometimes things don't work out as planned. This had been his life for the
            last three months and he was just beginning to get used to it. He didn't actually enjoy it, but he had accepted it and
            come to terms with it. Or at least he thought he had. All that changed when he put the key into the ignition, turned it
            and the engine didn't make a sound.</p>
            <p>Her breath exited her mouth in big puffs as if she were smoking a cigarette. The morning dew had made her clothes damp
            and she shivered from the chill in the air. There was only one thing that could get her up and out this early in the
            morning.</p>
            <p>You can decide what you want to do in life, but I suggest doing something that creates. Something that leaves a tangible
            thing once you're done. That way even after you're gone, you will still live on in the things you created.</p>
            <p>Twenty-five stars were neatly placed on the piece of paper. There was room for five more stars but they would be
            difficult ones to earn. It had taken years to earn the first twenty-five, and they were considered the "easy" ones.</p>
