            <p>Hopes and dreams were dashed that day. It should have been expected, but it still came as a shock. The warning signs had
            been ignored in favor of the possibility, however remote, that it could actually happen. That possibility had grown from
            hope to an undeniable belief it must be destiny. That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came crashing down.</p>
            <p>What have you noticed today? I noticed that if you outline the eyes, nose, and mouth on your face with your finger, you
            make an "I" which makes perfect sense, but is something I never noticed before. What have you noticed today?</p>
            <p>She didn't like the food. She never did. She made the usual complaints and started the tantrum he knew was coming. But
            this time was different. Instead of trying to placate her and her unreasonable demands, he just stared at her and
            watched her meltdown without saying a word.</p>
            <p>"Begin today!" That's all the note said. There was no indication from where it came or who may have written it. Had it
            been meant for someone else? Meghan looked around the room, but nobody made eye contact back. For a brief moment, she
            thought it might be a message for her to follow her dreams, but ultimately decided it was easier to ignore it as she
            crumpled it up and threw it away.</p>
            <p>His mother had always taught him not to ever think of himself as better than others. He'd tried to live by this motto.
            He never looked down on those who were less fortunate or who had less money than him. But the stupidity of the group of
            people he was talking to made him change his mind.</p>
            <p>The cab arrived late. The inside was in as bad of shape as the outside which was concerning, and it didn't appear that
            it had been cleaned in months. The green tree air-freshener hanging from the rearview mirror was either exhausted of its
            scent or not strong enough to overcome the other odors emitting from the cab. The correct decision, in this case, was to
            get the hell out of it and to call another cab, but she was late and didn't have a choice.</p>
