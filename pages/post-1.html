            Many people say that life isn't like a bed of roses. I beg to differ. I think that life is quite like a bed of roses.
            Just like life, a bed of roses looks pretty on the outside, but when you're in it, you find that it is nothing but
            thorns and pain. I myself have been pricked quite badly.</p>
            <p>How had she been so wrong? All her instincts and intuition completely failed her for the first time in her life. She had
            so heavily relied on both when making decisions up until this moment and she felt a seismic shift take place in her
            self-confidence. If she could be so completely wrong about something so simple as this, how could she make decisions
            about really important things taking place in her life? She wasn't sure what she should do next.</p>
            <p>The amber droplet hung from the branch, reaching fullness and ready to drop. It waited. While many of the other droplets
            were satisfied to form as big as they could and release, this droplet had other plans. It wanted to be part of history.
            It wanted to be remembered long after all the other droplets had dissolved into history. So it waited for the perfect
            specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of years in the future.
            I'm heading back to Colorado tomorrow after being down in Santa Barbara over the weekend for the festival there. I will
            be making October plans once there and will try to arrange so I'm back here for the birthday if possible. I'll let you
            know as soon as I know the doctor's appointment schedule and my flight plans.</p>
            <p>I don't like cats and they don't like me. I used to be allergic to them and I would get stuffed up and have hives. That
            doesn't seem to happen anymore. But I still don't like them. I lived with 3 cats that were not good at peeing in the
            litter box. They seemed to find something important to me and pee on it. Most of the time they peed on photographs or
            papers that would be ruined. Cats also bring fleas into the house. There is nothing worse than having to flea dip cats
            and also flea bomb a home. That is why I don't like cats.</p>
