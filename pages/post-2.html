            The answer was within her reach. It was hidden in a box and now that box sat directly in front of her. She'd spent years
            searching for it and could hardly believe she'd finally managed to find it. She turned the key to unlock the box and
            then gently lifted the top. She held her breath in anticipation of finally knowing the answer she had spent so much of
            her time in search of. As the lid came off she could see that the box was empty.
            The light blinded him. It was dark and he thought he was the only one in the area, but the light shining in his eyes
            proved him wrong. It came from about 100 feet away and was shining so directly into his eyes he couldn't make out
            anything about the person holding the light. There was only one thing to do in this situation. He reached into his
            pocket and pulled out a flashlight of his own that was much stronger than the one currently blinding him. He turned it
            on and pointed it into the stranger's eyes.</p>
            <p>Don't be scared. The things out there that are unknown aren't scary in themselves. They are just unknown at the moment.
            Take the time to know them before you list them as scary. Then the world will be a much less scary place for you.
            The leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years. It wore those scars with pride, feeling that they
            enhanced his presence rather than diminishing it. The scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point that
            it had become ratty. The jacket was in its prime and it knew it.</p>
            <p>This is important to remember. Love isn't like pie. You don't need to divide it among all your friends and loved ones.
            No matter how much love you give, you can always give more. It doesn't run out, so don't try to hold back giving it as
            if it may one day run out. Give it freely and as much as you want.</p>
            <p>She counted. One. She could hear the steps coming closer. Two. Puffs of breath could be seen coming from his mouth.
            Three. He stopped beside her. Four. She pulled the trigger of the gun.</p>
            <p>I'm meant to be writing at this moment. What I mean is, I'm meant to be writing something else at this moment. The
            document I'm meant to be writing is, of course, open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting my
            attention. Yet here I am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because it's easier to do than to work on
            anything particularly meaningful. I am grateful for the distraction.</p>
            <p>It's an unfortunate reality that we don't teach people how to make money (beyond getting a 9 to 5 job) as part of our
            education system. The truth is there are a lot of different, legitimate ways to make money. That doesn't mean they are
            easy and that you won't have to work hard to succeed, but it does mean that if you're willing to open your mind a bit
            you don't have to be stuck in an office from 9 to 5 for the next fifty years o your life.</p>
            <p>There was a time when this wouldn't have bothered her. The fact that it did actually bother her bothered her even more.
            What had changed in her life that such a small thing could annoy her so much for the entire day? She knew it was
            ridiculous that she even took notice of it, yet she was still obsessing over it as she tried to fall asleep.</p>
            <p>It was a good idea. At least, they all thought it was a good idea at the time. Hindsight would reveal that in reality,
            it was an unbelievably terrible idea, but it would take another week for them to understand that. Right now, at this
            very moment. they all agreed that it was the perfect course of action for the current situation.</p>
