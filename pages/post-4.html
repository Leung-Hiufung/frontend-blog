            <p>She's asked the question so many times that she barely listened to the answers anymore. The answers were always the
            same. Well, not exactly the same, but the same in a general sense. A more accurate description was the answers never
            surprised her. So, she asked for the 10,000th time, "What's your favorite animal?" But this time was different. When she
            heard the young boy's answer, she wondered if she had heard him correctly.</p>
            <p>The alarm went off and Jake rose awake. Rising early had become a daily ritual, one that he could not fully explain.
            From the outside, it was a wonder that he was able to get up so early each morning for someone who had absolutely no
            plans to be productive during the entire day.</p>
            <p>He walked down the steps from the train station in a bit of a hurry knowing the secrets in the briefcase must be secured
            as quickly as possible. Bounding down the steps, he heard something behind him and quickly turned in a panic. There was
            nobody there but a pair of old worn-out shoes were placed neatly on the steps he had just come down. Had he past them
            without seeing them? It didn't seem possible. He was about to turn and be on his way when a deep chill filled his body.
            The shoes had been there for as long as anyone could remember. In fact, it was difficult for anyone to come up with a
            date they had first appeared. It had seemed they'd always been there and yet they seemed so out of place. Why nobody had
            removed them was a question that had been asked time and again, but while they all thought it, nobody had ever found the
            energy to actually do it. So, the shoes remained on the steps, out of place in one sense, but perfectly normal in
            another.</p>
            <p>Mary had to make a decision and she knew that whatever decision she made, it would upset someone. It seemed like such a
            silly reason for people to get upset but she knew the minute that she began to consider doing it that there was no way
            everyone in her life would be pleased with what she ultimately decided to do. It was simply a question of who she would
            rather displease most. While this had always been her parents, and especially her mom, in the past that she tried to
            keep from upsetting, she decided that this time the person she was going to please the most with her decision was
            herself.</p>
            <p>The headphones were on. They had been utilized on purpose. She could hear her mom yelling in the background, but
            couldn't make out exactly what the yelling was about. That was exactly why she had put them on. She knew her mom would
            enter her room at any minute, and she could pretend that she hadn't heard any of the previous yelling.</p>
            <p>A two-inch layer of freshly fallen snow covered the yard. Stacey peeked outside. To most, it would have been a beautiful
            sight worthy of taking a photo to put on Instagram. For Stacey, it meant something different. The first snow of the year
            brought back the witches as the fairies in the yard had to seek shelter to avoid the cold.</p>
            <p>The red ball sat proudly at the top of the toybox. It had been the last to be played with and anticipated it would be
            the next as well. The other toys grumbled beneath. At one time each had held the spot of the red ball, but over time
            they had sunk deeper and deeper into the toy box.</p>
            <p>There was something in the sky. What exactly was up there wasn't immediately clear. But there was definitely something
            in the sky and it was getting bigger and bigger.</p>
            <p>There was a time when this wouldn't have bothered her. The fact that it did actually bother her bothered her even more.
            What had changed in her life that such a small thing could annoy her so much for the entire day? She knew it was
            ridiculous that she even took notice of it, yet she was still obsessing over it as she tried to fall asleep.</p>
            <p>It was a simple tip of the hat. Grace didn't think that anyone else besides her had even noticed it. It wasn't anything
            that the average person would notice, let alone remember at the end of the day. That's why it seemed so unbelievable
            that this little gesture would ultimately change the course of the world.</p>
            <p>He looked at the sand. Picking up a handful, he wondered how many grains were in his hand. Hundreds of thousands? "Not
            enough," the said under his breath. I need more.</p>
            <p>He had three simple rules by which he lived. The first was to never eat blue food. There was nothing in nature that was
            edible that was blue. People often asked about blueberries, but everyone knows those are actually purple. He understood
            it was one of the stranger rules to live by, but it had served him well thus far in the 50+ years of his life.</p>
            <p>He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the beginning. That was what made the choice so
            difficult. What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same. This would have been fine if he were
            willing to face the inevitable consequences, but he wasn't.</p>
            <p>It was a good idea. At least, they all thought it was a good idea at the time. Hindsight would reveal that in reality,
            it was an unbelievably terrible idea, but it would take another week for them to understand that. Right now, at this
            very moment. they all agreed that it was the perfect course of action for the current situation.</p>
            <p>It was a rat's nest. Not a literal one, but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up. It
            was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it. She peered into the mirror
            and wondered if it was worth it. It wasn't. She opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers.</p>
            <p>Finding the red rose in the mailbox was a pleasant surprise for Sarah. She didn't have a boyfriend or know of anyone who
            was interested in her as anything more than a friend. There wasn't even a note attached to it. Although it was a
            complete mystery, it still made her heart jump and race a little more than usual. She wished that she could simply
            accept the gesture and be content knowing someone had given it to her, but that wasn't the way Sarah did things. Now it
            was time to do a little detective work and try to figure who had actually left the red rose.</p>
            <p>Trees. It was something about the trees. The way they swayed with the wind in unison. The way they shaded the area
            around them. The sounds of their leaves in the wind and the creaks from the branches as they sway, The trees were making
            a statement that I just couldn't understand.</p>
            <p>She reached her goal, exhausted. Even more chilling to her was that the euphoria that she thought she'd feel upon
            reaching it wasn't there. Something wasn't right. Was this the only feeling she'd have for over five years of hard work?
            With six children in tow, Catherine raced to the airport departing gate. This wasn't an easy task as the children had
            other priorities than to get to the gate. She knew that she was tight on time and the frustration came out as she yelled
            at the kids to keep up. They continued to test her, pretending not to listen and to move in directions that only slowed
            them down. They had no idea the wrath they were about to receive when Catherine made it to the gate only to be informed
            that they had all missed the plane.</p>
